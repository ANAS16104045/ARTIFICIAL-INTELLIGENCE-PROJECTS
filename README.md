Motion detection is the process of detecting a change in the position of an object relative to its surroundings or a change in the surroundings relative to an object. Motion detection can be achieved by either mechanical or electronic methods. When motion detection is accomplished by natural organisms, it is called motion perception.

METHODS 

Motion can be detected by:


• Infrared (passive and active sensors)

• Optics (video and camera systems)

• Radio Frequency (radar, microwave and tomographic motion detection)

• Magnetism (magnetic sensors and magnetometers)

Motion detection is usually a software-based monitoring algorithm which, when it detects motions will signal the surveillance camera to begin capturing the event. Also called activity detection, an advanced motion detection surveillance system can analyze the type of motion to see if it warrants an alarm.

Applications of Motion Detection

Some of the key applications of motion detectors include: 

• Intruder alarms • Automatic ticket gates

• Entry way lighting • Security lighting

• Automated sinks/toilet flusher

• Hand dryers

• Automatic doors
